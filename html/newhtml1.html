                <p class="p1"> It not like you are getting a flyer made or a newsletter that is printed and has a constant canvas size explains Matt Felten, a Los Angeles-based product designer.The proliferation of the iPhone means that designers have to adapt to variable screen sizes and come up with new methods for a plethora of different devices. Responsive design means that no matter how big a screen is  from a phone to a watch to a tablet to a desktop the site will fill the screen.</p>

                    <p class="h2">Tab</p>
                </div>
                <p class="p2">Module tabs are seeing an increase of use as websites and web applications push for optimizing web page screen areas without sacrificing the amount of information presented at once. For example, in weblogs,  they are used in secondary content sections (such as the sidebar) to present relevant and interesting information such as a listing of blog posts which users can interact with to get to web pages quicker. This inevitably allows for an unobtrusive and compact.</p>

                <p class="p3"> We updated the visits and engagement metrics for websites to include both desktop and mobile web data. Previously, the metrics were desktop-only, and mobile web data was available separately. We added fresh data to mobile web so you can now see the daily visits and engagement for the last 28 days. We believe that these changes will enable you to better understand the multi-platform digital world, helping you make more informed business decisions. </p>
