        <p>Due to religious reasons, a lot of people in India do not eat beef or pork, making chicken the most common meat in Indian cuisine. Some of India's most famous dishes use chicken, including many that are enjoyed worldwide at Indian restaurants. You can enjoy the authentic taste of your favorite spiced chicken dishes at home with these recipes.
Butter chicken is an iconic Indian dish. It's also known as murg makhani and tastes great with basmati rice or naan (leavened tandoor-baked Indian flatbread). The chicken is marinated a couple of times for optimal flavor and tenderness before being cooked with ginger, garlic, tomato, chicken stock, and spices.
Among the most famous Indian foods, tandoori chicken is loved by people the world over. The nice thing about this dish is that it's really easy to make. It gets its name from the way it is cooked—in a tandoor, or clay oven. After the chicken is marinated in a spiced yogurt mixture, the pieces are threaded onto skewers and then placed in the tandoor to cook. Don't worry if you don't have a tandoor—this recipe calls for cooking the chicken in the traditional oven
Chicken tikka masala is a delicious dish of marinated pieces of chicken that are grilled and then added to a thick, creamy gravy. Plan ahead so the chicken can marinate overnight in yogurt and spices before cooking with onion, tomatoes, and cream.​ This dish can also be made in a pressure cooker like an Instant Pot.
The thick, creamy gravy of Mughlai chicken is inspired by the food of Central Asia. It is an ideal dish for special occasions because it is so rich and decadent tasting thanks to lots of spices, ghee, homemade almond paste, and a touch of cream. Surprisingly, it only takes about 30 minutes to prepare.
A regal dish, Mughlai biryani is fit for a king (and was probably eaten by many of them). This recipe makes the perfect one-dish meal to cook up when you have company. Consisting of chicken (or lamb), rice, yogurt, and many spices, it is a filling and flavorful layered dish.
Yogurt and ground almonds give chicken korma its body, while a long list of tasty spices adds layers of flavor. Adjust the level of heat to suit your palate, reducing or increasing the chili powder or even swapping it for fresh, minced chili pepper.
This South Indian curry is quite fiery, but you can reduce the chiles to suit your own palate. Typical of many Indian recipes, the whole spices are toasted and then ground before being mixed with ginger and garlic to create a spice paste. Combined with curry leaves and tomatoes, the chicken simmers until tender to create a delicious and spicy Chettinad chicken curry.
A great make-ahead dish, chicken dhansak parsi tastes even better the next day. You can make it with chicken, lamb, or goat and it's always delicious. It is a Persian and Gujarati (western India) recipe combining lentils, vegetables, meat, and fragrant spices. Don't be deterred by the number of ingredients—most are dried spices.
A light curry dish common in northern India, chicken saagwala consists of pan-fried chicken combined with spinach and a flavorful sauce. It is one of the healthier choices on Indian menus. Pair it with rice and you have a complete meal the whole family will love.

A fragrant rice dish with a few different moving parts, make this Bombay biryani for a big family meal. Luckily it's a one-dish meal, with chicken, potatoes, eggs, dried plums, tomatoes, and more. Serve with raita for a hint of creaminess that will balance out the heat.
This basic chicken recipe is also one of the tastiest. Although many chicken curries include yogurt or cream, this recipe creates a thickening agent by processing the fried onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger into a paste. Serve chicken curry with hot chapatis (Indian flatbread) or white rice.
